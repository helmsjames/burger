BURGER RESTAURANT
===============
* This program runs on a local server through node.js

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has an "Eat it up" and "Delete" button. When the user clicks the "Eat it up" button it will move to the "Devoured" section of the page.  When they click "Delete" it will be removed completely.

* Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
